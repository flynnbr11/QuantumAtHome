    Before reading this section, make sure youâ€™ve read about <a href="superposition.html">states and measurement</a>! We reuse some ideas and notation here. </p>

Finally, particles can become entangled. This is where the properties of one particle are intrinsically linked to the properties of another. Say we are both holding lightbulbs, and we entangle them, and now our <i>combined</i> quantum system of lightbulbs has a superposition state (50% on-on, 50% off-off). Then I go to the other end of the universe. You measure your lightbulb and find it to be off. You know immediately, without any communication from me, that my lightbulb has to be off, because of the initial entanglement the lightbulbs shared.
