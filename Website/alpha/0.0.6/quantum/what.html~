    A lot of times on this website, and everywhere people talk about quantum mechanics, the words quantum and classical get used freely. It's important to first understand what these things mean, to begin to understand where the benefit of quantum mechanics can come from. Some of the many other words that are thrown around are states, measurement, entanglement, tunnnelling. You can read about these concepts by clicking on the sidebar to the left. We have included videos which succinctly sum up the concept to the level you need to grasp why the  home stands to benefit from quantum technologies.

     <i>Classical</i> physics is what you experience every day. It describes nature on the <i>macro</i>scopic scale, which means at the size humans exist. It's intuitive: classical physics describes things like pendulumns swinging and gravity making apples fall from trees and the earth revolve around the sun. In the simplest terms, classical physics describes things that are big, or at least bigger than single particles.

    <i> Quantum </i> physics on the other hand, is the study of the very very small: a few particles. It was noticed in the early twentieth century that the laws of physics, the best description of nature known at that point, failed to explain some effects at the <i>micro</i>scopic scale (a billionth of a metre). When many particles are bunched together, their groupings form molecules. When many molecules group together, they form solids and materials. These are what we are familiar with on our human scale: essentially billions of atoms tied together to form a single item. These items have mass, which is what classical physics assumed was causing interactions between items. This is true for big enough items where the mass is high, compared with single atoms at least. That's why classical physics seemed to be the true description of nature for so long, and indeed it is good enough for the calculations needed for most engineering tasks, including making car engines and aeroplanes fly. </p>

    When one (or a very small number) of particles are kept away from billions of others, they behave according to the most fundamental laws of nature. In fact, they do act like this when bunched together, but when there are billions of atoms grouped together, one or two doing strange things are completely unnoticable. Those strange things are the quantum effects physicists have been learning about for almost a century. These processes are just now being understood well enough that we can take advantage of them in technologies. This website gives you an idea of how these items <i>might</i> start to be used day-to-day, outside the lab, and especially in the home.

    This website was built as part of a study of domestic quantum technologies. This study forms a scientific document including full references. This is aimed at trained scientists so includes more involved maths and physics, but you can check out the full document here.
