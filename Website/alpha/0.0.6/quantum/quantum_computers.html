            <p> Quantum computers are the most famous and powerful quantum technology yet considered. Building such a machine is massively challenging, however. An overview of what quantum computers would be capable of is given in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhHMJCUmq28">this video</a>. </p>
            <p> All quantum technology can be traced to its origin in the 1980s, when Richard Feynmann suggested that to simulate the quantum nature of chemistry would require a quantum simulation device. This idea grew into the idea of a Quantum Computer, capable of generic tasks and which offered solutions to problems normal computers can't achieve. 
            The field of quantum computing was advanced in the 90's by the realisation that a quantum algorithm could be used to factorise large numbers (Shor's algorithm). This cast doubt on modern methods of encryption, and indicated that quantum computers may be useful tools for a number of tasks.
