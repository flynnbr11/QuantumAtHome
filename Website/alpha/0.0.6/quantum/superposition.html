       <p> Quantum systems have the unique property of <i>superposition</i>. This means that the system is simultaneously in two or more <i>states</i>. When we <i>measure</i> a state, it collapses (chooses only one of its initial states). A great example of this is Schrodinger's Cat, the famous thought experiment originally devised to show how counterintuitive the very idea of quantum mechanics is. He was originally trying to discredit the theory by highlighting that it is contrary to our perception of reality. In the end, however, experiments over the next fifty years proved that the theory is correct and does explain the universe at the most fundamental level we know. Quantum mechanics is now the most experimentally tested theory of all time.

      <h2> Quantum States </h2>

<p>  A <i>state</i> is a description of how the system physically exists at that moment in time. For example, a light switch can exist in two states: on and off. These are complete opposites of each other: while it is in one state (e.g. on), it can not be in the other (off).  An example of a quantum system is an atom, and an example of a state is the position of that atom. Experiments have proven that this is true and not just mathematically convenient.
</p>

       <h2> Superposition </h2>
<p>      Superposition is the phenomenon whereby a quantum system can exist in two states simultaneously. Think again about our lightbulb from above: the light switch is completely on and completely off. It is convenient to think about this as being in two states at the same time but really it is an entirely different state composed of two the possibilities. A superposition state is how we mathematically represent this simultaneous existence. We say that the lightbulb has <i>probabilities</i> of being on and off. One superposition is the lightbulb being (50% on, 50% off); another superposition might be (80% on, 20% off). These come into play when the system is measured.
</p>
        
       <h2> Measurement </h2>
        Measurement is the act of <i>observing</i> your quantum system. Suppose your light bulb is in a superposition of on and off while you're in the garden. When you walk inside, you observe the lightbulb. You force it to pick either on or off: the state <i>collapses</i>. Whether the lightbulb collapses into on or off depends on the probabilities of the initial state, which may have been a superposition to begin with. If you had a million lightbulbs in a million houses, all in the identical state, (50% on, 50% off), and a million people went inside from their gardens, they perform measurements on all of them. Statistically, half of them would see the light as on, and the other half off.
          
        <h2> Schrodinger's Cat </h2>        
        <p> A good example tying all of this together is Schrodinger's Cat. Schrodinger imagined locking a cat into a sealed box with an unstable explosive (say that the explosive has a 50% chance of exploding within one minute, and we wouldn't be able to see/hear the explosion from outside the sealed box). </p>

		<p>
		Classically, we expect that there is a 50% chance that the explosive will kill the cat, and so there is a 50% chance that the cat will be be alive after one minute. If we think about it from the quantum perspective, however, we say that the explosive is in a <i>superposition</i> state of having exploded and not. That is, it <i>both</i> exploded and did not explode, simultaneously, within the box. The knock on effect of this event (explosion), is that it would certainly kill the cat. Therefore, the <i>cat itself</i> is now in a superposition state, of being both alive and dead.

    <a href="http://www.physicsoftheuniverse.com/scientists_schrodinger.html">Schrodinger</a> thought that this idea was so unrealistic and unphysical that the entire idea of quantum mechanics is wrong, even though he was one of the founding fathers of the field! Later experiments proved that indeed this idea of superposition is accurate to what nature does.
