       <p> Quantum systems have the unique property of superposition. This means that the system is simultaneously in two states. One of the most fascinating aspects of quantum mechanics is what happens when we look at the state: it collapses to be in only one state. </p>
        
        <p> A good example of this is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOYyCHGWJq4">Schrodinger's Cat:</a> a thought experiment originally devised by a famous physicist in the 1930's to demonstrate how ridiculous the idea of quantum mechanics is. Schrodinger imagined locking a cat into a sealed box with a poisonous source. </p>
