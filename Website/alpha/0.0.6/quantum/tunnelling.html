      Imagine you are looking up at a wall. The wall is very tall and you are not very good at climbing. Climbing the wall, in a physics context, would take a lot of energy. Now imagine that instead of going over the wall, you could just appear on the other side. Welcome to the world of quantum tunneling. 
</p>
<p>
For quantum systems, say an electron, the wall represents a barrier. In a classical world there is no way other than climbing the wall to get to the other side, and only by giving the electron a lot of energy would it be able to climb over. Because the position state of an electron can be described as a superposition, and one part of that superposition state exists on the other side of the wall, the particle has a probability of being on the other side! When it is measured (its state collapses), it is now on the other side of the "wall": it has tunnelled through.

<p>
This  phenomenon is the tool exploited by scanning tunnel electron microscopes to take detailed images of the surface of materials, [and an approach to quantum technologies called quantum annealing… this is the approach taken by the most advanced quantum tech currently commercially available, DWave] and quantum annealing computation in the field of quantum technologies. A classical computer would need to work their way around problems by “climbing the wall” whereas a quantum annealer can tunnel through. 
		
		
Exploiting this phenomenon is one of the approaches to quantum computation, called quantum annealing. This is the approach taken by one of the most advanced current commercial quantum efforts, <a href="https://www.dwavesys.com/home" target="_blank"> D-Wave</a>.

		In fact, quantum tunneling is one of the problems facing classical computation! Because transistors are now so small (on the scale of individual atoms) quantum effects are starting to come into play. Electrons flowing through a transistor now have a certain probability of tunneling, corresponding to a flowing current, even when the transistor is meant to be in an off state. This could result in the electrons being in the wrong place, causing errors in the machines operations.
