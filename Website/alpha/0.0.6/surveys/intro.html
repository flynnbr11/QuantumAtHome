We collected some data on people’s thoughts on quantum technologies: attendants at the <a href="http://www.bnhc.org.uk/festival-of-nature/bristol-festival-nature/" target="_blank">Festival of Nature in Bristol</a>; researchers in the <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/physics/research/quantum/" target="_blank">Bristol Centre for Quantum Photonics</a>; and we polled over 2000 students, lecturers and University staff. 
</p>
<p>
The UK government has <a href="https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/research/ourportfolio/themes/quantumtech/" target="_blank">invested £270 million in quantum technologies </a> and the European union plans to <a href="http://qurope.eu/system/files/u7/93056_Quantum%20Manifesto_WEB.pdf" target="_blank"> invest €1 billion</a>, clearly the prevailing belief is that these technologies will open new markets, improve our lives and push the boundaries of science even further.

So we wondered: What do people inside and outside the industry know and think about these technologies? Here are some of the results.
