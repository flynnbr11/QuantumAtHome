Through the scientific method hypothesis can be tested by collecting data and evidence. Scientists, you would think, can agree about the objective facts they study. However, on the cutting edge of technology the wealth of possibilities, arguments, questionable data means that even scientists who work in the same group cannot agree on some things!

For example, we found that predictions for the advent of widespread adoption of quantum computation ranged from 5 years to 50 years. That said the overwhelming majority agreed that quantum computation was 10+ years away (86%). Other technologies were more uncertain, for those technologies where the most common response was 5-10 years from commercial adoption and the percentage of people who chose that: quantum enhanced cameras (50%), quantum key distribution (49%), quantum magnetic sensors (66%) and quantum gravity sensors (42%). Only for quantum random number generators was the most common response less than 5 years (60%)!

In terms of the race to develop a quantum computer Google came out as a clear winner, the pie chart below showing the ratio of “1st” position choices.
