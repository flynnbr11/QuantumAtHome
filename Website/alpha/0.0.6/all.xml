        <description>Classical methods of securely transferring money by credit/debit card and withdrawing money using an ATM, as well as authentication, where an automated method using random numbers (or, currently more often, pseudo-random numbers) is used to check that the user is who they say they are have potential security flaws. These can be solved using the ideas of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). Random numbers are generated using a quantum random number generator (or otherwise) and stored in memory of the device. For each random bit, one of four LEDs is used to emit a single photon polarised in either the horizontal, vertical, diagonal or antidiagonal direction. Each photon is then measured by the receiving device, which is the only other device that knows the random number being used. The received random number is then compared with what it should have been and a match indicates that the person is who they say they are, assuming the card hasn’t been physically stolen. The same method can be used to authenticate card transactions and cash withdrawals. The technology already exists and could potentially cost around £10 for each</description>

        <description>It is known that both the human heart and brain generate a detectable magnetic field, and
measurement of this field has been used in medical research and diagnosis for many years. Such
measurements have previously been carried out using superconducting quantum interference
devices, or SQUIDS. These devices can sense changes in biomagnetic fields with extreme precision by
using interference in a superconducting circuit (a circuit which has zero electrical resistance).
However, this technique is limited as the circuit requires cooling to temperatures of at most -200ºC.
This makes it difficult to imagine having such a device for health monitoring in the home. However,
recent developments have enabled quantum magnetic field sensors to operate at room
temperature. These devices use atomic magnetrometry, whereby one laser beam is used to align the
atomic spins of a vapour in the presence of a magnetic field to be measured. Then a second laser
beam can be used to estimate the magnetic field from the rotation in the polarisation of this beam
as it passes through this vapour. The measurement in this case is a special kind of quantum
measurement called a ‘quantum non-demolition measurement’, which means the measurement can
occur without altering the atomic spins when the light passes through. This technique can in theory
increase the sensitivity of these devices while not needing extreme cooling, and has already been
shown to improve the bandwidth of magnetic sensors. This has been used to sense the magnetic
fields in the heart and brain, and can also be used to achieve MRI scanning without having to
cryogenically cool the device. The ability to make such a device compact and work at room
temperature could lead to their use in the home for regular health monitoring, which could lead to
early diagnosis of many diseases, potentially saving many lives in the near future.</description>

        <description>Mind controlled wheelchairs may seem like a thing of the distant future, but electromagnetic
sensing of brain signals is already being used to develop a Brain-computer Interface (BCI) to enable
direct communication between the brain the wheelchair. These systems detect
electroencephalographic (EEG) signals with a number of electrodes placed on the persons head.
However, they often suffer from poor resolution and excess noise, making it difficult to accurately
translate the brain signal to move the wheelchair in the right direction. Quantum-enhanced sensing
could provide the means to provide a commercially viable Neural-sensing wheelchair, due to the
latest developments in devices for the quantum magnetic sensing of brain signals. These devices use
atomic magnetrometry, whereby a laser beam is used to align the atomic spins of a vapour in the
presence of a magnetic field to be measured. Then a second laser beam can be used to estimate the
magnetic field from the rotation in the polarisation of this beam as it passes through this vapour.
The measurement in this case is a special kind of quantum measurement called a ‘quantum non-
demolition measurement’, which means the measurement can occur without altering the atomic
spins when the light passes through. This technique can increase the sensitivity of magnetic field
measurements dramatically, and has already been used to sense magnetic fields from the brain. If
such a device could be made more compact it is entirely possible that the technology could provide
people suffering from paralysis the ability to control their wheelchair just by thinking!</description>

        <description>Solar cells have transformed the way we harvest energy in recent years, and promise to be a
significant part of achieving a sustainable future. However, a major barrier to this progress is the
limited efficiency which has been achieved in solar cells to date, and in current solar technologies
these inefficiencies stem from fluctuations in the light received by the solar cell. Quantum physics
has recently been shown to provide a significant advantage in improving the efficiency of solar
power, by naturally regulating the energy received to produce a steady state output from the
fluctuating input. These quantum solar cells are made by combining two materials that are linked by
a quantum energy transition. This means that incoming particle of light (photon) can be absorbed
such that its energy is converted to electronic energy in the form of electric power. Today’s solar
technology also works by joining material linked by an energy gap such that individual photons are
absorbed, giving extra energy to electrons. However, the quantum solar cells are distinct from their
classical counterpart because in the quantum case the energy gap is formed from two individual
quantum states with different energy, such as you would find in an atom, rather than the energy
levels arising as a property of a large-scale material, as in the classical case.
The energy regulation works by having two ‘quantum channels’ which are used to channel energy
efficiently through the photocell. One channel absorbs at a colour of light which is providing a high
average intensity, and the other channel absorbs colours of light with low intensity. In order to make
the output energy as constant as possible, the quantum solar cell switches randomly between the
high and the low energy channel. Incredibly, it was found that green light does not provide a benefit
by switching in this way, so the device can increase the amount of energy it can make by not
absorbing as much green light as it does all the other colours. Plants all around us have this same
property, and this may be because of a similar kind of quantum benefit researchers have found using
these devices. In fact, in recent studies of the microscopic nature of plants, a molecular structure
proposed on the basis of its photosynthetic properties has interesting similarities to the quantum
solar cells discussed here. It is remarkable that we can turn to nature for hints about how we can
reduce our carbon footprint with the latest quantum technologies.</description>
