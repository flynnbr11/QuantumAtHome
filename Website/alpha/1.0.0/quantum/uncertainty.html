    <h2> Uncertainty in science</h2>
    <div id="quantum_diagram"><img width="250px" src="pics/map_uncertainty.png"></img> </div>

    <p> Uncertainty is how we measure our knowledge of a system, by calculating how unsure we are about it. For example, a GPS tracker on your smartphone will identify your location as in the kitchen, with a radius of uncertainty of five metres, as in the picture on the left. </p> 
    
    <p> It has calculated, via satellite communication, that your phone is positioned at a very precise point. However, this calculation depended on a number of values which change frequently. If your phone becomes disconnected from the satellites for a moment, it can not receive information on where the satellite is relative to the phone. Instead, it uses data from its most recent communication with the satellite. This will be slightly out of date (by less than a second or two): since that data was sent, the phone has moved slightly, so where the satellite is relative to the phone is now a slightly different value. The GPS uses the slightly-old value, and calculates position using that, but it knows that it hasn't received data in a while, and so it knows that the result of its calculation may be slightly inaccurate. It also knows, however, how long it has been since it <i> did</i> receive data - it has an idea of how wrong it <i>might</i> be. So it can also compute the maximum amount it got your position wrong by. This maximum value for incorrect calculation is its uncertainty. </p>
    <p> The concept of uncertainty is used in all aspects of science - without taking account of how inaccurate calculations are in the worst case scenario where everything has gone wrong, we could not trust our results. 
    </p>
    <h2> Heisenberg's Principle </h2>
    <p>
    <a href="http://www.physicsoftheuniverse.com/scientists_heisenberg.html" target="_blank"> Heisenberg</a>, along with Schrodinger, was involved in the early discoveries of quantum mechanics. His most famous contribution is the uncertainty principle. This arises from a system having two intertwined properties, whose uncertainties are therefore also intertwined. For example, a single particle has a number of properties which describe it. Two of these properties are position and speed - where is it and how fast is it going. A more general concept of speed is <i>momentum</i>, which tells us not only how fast it's going, but also in the direction as well as how difficult it is to stop.  We can think of momentum as a measure of the particle's energy. 
     </p>
    <p>
    The particle's speed is intricately linked to its position (e.g. if it were moving twice as fast, it would be twice as far away from where it started). Both of these properties have uncertainty. It might seem unusual to have uncertainty in posistion. After all, if you know where you parked your car, you could pinpoint it very precisely on a map. Likewise, while driving in a car, you get a highly accurate reading of your speed at all times. Remember we're talking about extremely small particles here, though, such as atoms. It's impossible to know the position and speed of particles that precisely, so our knowledge of these properties are both assigned uncertainties. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle says that when these individual uncertainties are multiplied together, that value must be greater than or equal to some quantum limit.

    <h2> Squeezing </h2>
    <p>
    It is possible to squeeze this uncertainty. The uncertainty principle says that the uncertainty in one property, e.g. position, <i>multiplied</i> by the uncertainty in another property, momentum, must always be greater than, or equal to, some limit. As we become more sure about position, our uncertainty for momentum goes up. This is what's known as squeezing: we've prioritised one of the proprties and sacrificed uncertainty in the other.
